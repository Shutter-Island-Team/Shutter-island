# Ecosystem generator - Bibliography

This file lists the main references with a quick description our project is based on. 



## Environment generation

### Map Generation

This [article](http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~amitp/game-programming/polygon-map-generation/) on the Red Blob Games website gives a really good introduction to the problem of map generation. Even if the solution proposed seems quite simple, it gives a good overview of the problem.

### Rivers

This [Siggraph paper](http://paris.siggraph.org/activites/2012-13/recherche-les-meilleurs-papiers-de-l-afig/AFIG-GenerationProceduraleRivieresTerrains.pdf) is about rivers generation. It is left here as a further work to implement.


## Boids

### Reference of boids

This [chapter](http://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-6-autonomous-agents/) of The Nature Of Code is quite a reference to start working on boids.

### State automaton

This [article](http://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/tutorials/finite-state-machines-squad-pattern-using-steering-behaviors--gamedev-13638) was used as a complement to implement the automaton-based behaviour.


## OpenGL

### Tessellation 

This [master thesis](http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:566135/FULLTEXT01.pdf) contains a quite clear introduction to Tessellation in OpenGL4 and also provides a functionnal code.
